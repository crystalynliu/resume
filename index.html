            <div class="details">
              <p>
                <strong>As a Full Stack Developer</strong>, I was fully
                responsible for a backend service that including development,
                building, and deployment. The technologies I used included
                <strong
                  >React, Next.js, Node.js, NestJs, Postgres, Prisma, Subgraph,
                  etc</strong
                >.
              </p>
              <p>
                In this role, I faced the challenge of being the sole backend developer on the project.
                <strong>
                  When I joined the company, there was no handover from any previous developer,
                  so I had to independently read and analyze the existing codebase to understand the business logic.
                  For new requirements, I needed to thoroughly analyze and interpret them to make the right technical decisions and prioritize tasks effectively.
                </strong>
              </p>

              <p>
                Key achievements and problem-solving highlights:
              </p>
              <p>
                1. Twitter API Integration:
                I was responsible for integrating the Twitter API into the project.
                This involved studying the official Twitter documentation, understanding the OAuth authorization flow, and evaluating different access levels.
                I also reviewed technical requirements to help the team decide on purchasing the appropriate Twitter Developer account plan.
              </p>
              <p>
                2. Production Performance Issue:
                After deployment, we encountered severe performance issues due to slow SQL queries. 
                Under a sudden surge in user traffic, the database CPU usage reached 100%, causing service outages. 
                Given the urgency of the production issue, I quickly analyzed the slow queries, identified performance bottlenecks in the SQL, and performed data migration to optimize the system, ultimately resolving the problem.
              </p>
              <p>
                3. CI/CD Pipeline Improvements:
                I initiated the implementation of automated test checks in our CI/CD pipeline to ensure that code modifications would not break existing functionality. 
                This significantly improved code stability and reduced the bug rate

              <p>
                <strong>As one of only two developers in a startup</strong>, I
                was fully responsible for the front-end projects and a backend
                blockchain data-fetching service that including development,
                building, and deployment. The technologies I used included
                <strong

              </p>
              <p>
                During this journey, the main challenge I faced was my lack of
                prior experience with the Solana blockchain.
                <strong
                  >I had to learn the foundational concepts of Solana blockchain
                  from scratch and successfully delivered features like wallet
                  integration, transaction handling, and transaction data
                  storage within the expected timeline</strong
                >.
              </p>
              <p>
                While fetching data from the Solana blockchain, I encountered
                the issue of the data retrieval speed lagging behind Solana's
                block production rate. By step-by-step testing of RPC response
                times, server bandwidth, and optimizing the parallel data
                processing in the code, I was able to identify the bottleneck
                and optimize the performance.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, I advocated for and implemented Sentry for service
                monitoring and alerting, ensuring service stability and enabling
                timely issue resolution.
